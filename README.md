## 🚀 Run Locally

Because this is a static site, you can open it directly:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click it)

**Recommended (local server)** so relative paths work reliably:

### Option A — VS Code Live Server
1. Install the **Live Server** extension
2. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**

### Option B — Python (built-in)
From inside the `my website` folder:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
